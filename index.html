title: What are keystone enhancers?
---

<p>Recently proposed enhancer therapy strategies offer compelling possibilities for treating diseases in which only subsets of cells are pathogenic, such as tissue-specific autoimmunity, as they would allow modulation of gene expression within particular cell types via their enhancers. However, targeting a single enhancer often yields minimal change in gene expression levels because enhancer networks are redundantly wired. We hypothesize that despite this redundancy, there exist "keystone enhancers" that have an outsized effect on the genes they regulate. These keystone enhancers are anomalies–errors in the robust system that governs transcription–and thus offer unique opportunities to affect gene expression in a cell- and cell-subtype-specific manner. We propose to develop methods to systematically identify keystone enhancers, first within a model of high- versus low-affinity T cell stimulation, and subsequently to edit these keystone enhancers and the associated cell phenotype, ultimately advancing towards effective enhancer therapy.
