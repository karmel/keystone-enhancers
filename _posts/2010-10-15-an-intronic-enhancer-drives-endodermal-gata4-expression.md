category: examples

Rojas A, Schachterle W, Xu SM, Mart√≠n F, Black BL. Direct transcriptional regulation of Gata4 during early endoderm specification is controlled by FoxA2 binding to an intronic enhancer. _Dev Biol_. 2010 Oct 15;346(2):346-55. <a class="pubmed-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20692247" target="_blank">[Pubmed]</a>

#### Summary
The transcription factor Gata4 is essential for gut morphogenesis, and is expressed in distinct endodermal tissues throughout embryogenesis. Though expression is initially widespread, Gata4 is later restricted to the dorsal foregut and midgut, and here the authors identify an intronic enhancer that is activated by Foxa2 only in these later tissues.

* The definitive endoderm transforms into the primitive gut tube, which develops into foregut, midgut, and hindgut dependent on localized signals along the anterior-posterior axis
* Foxa2 and Gata4 are crucial lineage-determining factors in the definitive endoderm
* Gata4 is the first of the Gata family to be expressed in the endoderm. It is first expressed broadly, but as embryogenesis progresses, is limited to specific endodermal tissues
* Conservation across mouse, human, and opossum was used to define nine conserved non-coding regions around the Gata4 locus, named G1-G9
* The authors previously characterized G2 and G8 as a lateral mesoderm and late-acting endoderm enhancers, respectively. However, these two enhancers could only account for a subset of Gata4 expression patterns
* Each of the conserved regions was cloned into a transgenic reporter and tested for activity in mouse embryos
* G4, a 1107 bp region contained in an intron of Gata4 between exons 2 and 3, was sufficient to drive the reporter
* Seven independent Gata4-G4-lacZ lines were generated
* Beta-gal expression was observed at E7.5 in the visceral endoderm of the yolk sac; at E8.5 in the primitive gut tube; at E9.5 in the ventral and dorsal gut tube, restricted to the midgut; at E11.5 in a subset of endoderm-derived organs; at E13.5 only in some cells of the dorsal pancreas and the hind stomach; and by later stages in fetal development, nowhere.
* Beta-gal expression aligned well with Foxa2 staining
* Beta-gal expression aligned well much but not all of Gata4 staining, as expected based on the existence of multiple enhancers
* Beta-gal expression was observed in the floor plate, even though Gata4 was not. Perhaps there is some secondary suppression of the endogenous G4 enhancer that is not captured by the transgene?
* Gata4-G4Gp-Cre x Rosa26R mice reveal that the G4-expressing endoderm tissue gives rise to much of the extra-embryonic, endoderm-derived organs
* Recombinant Foxa2 binds to the endogenous G4 enhancer (EMSA, and Chip in a pancreatic cell line)
* Mutating the forkhead consensus motif in the lacZ transgene leads to loss of beta-gal in all of the previously observed endoderm locations
* Thus, G4 regulates tissue-specific Gata4 expression in the early endoderm, and is bound and activated by Foxa2 such that Foxa2 can initiated Gata4 expression and then the two together engage endodermal transcriptional programs


#### Observations

* An interesting case where gene expression is not necessarily tissue-specific, but where the gene is perhaps controlled by different enhancers in different tissues
* Notably, the authors demonstrate that G4 is sufficient to drive a transgene, but not that it is necessary or sufficient for Gata4 expression in endodermal tissue; this is not a proven keystone enhancer
* Conservation here as a crucial metric
* ENCODE shows robust Foxa1/2, HNF4a, HDAC2, Sp1, and CEBPb binding in HepG2 cells
* In hESCs, silencing mark (H3K27me3)
