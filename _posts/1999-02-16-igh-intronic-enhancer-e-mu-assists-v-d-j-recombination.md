Sakai E, Bottaro A, Davidson L, Sleckman BP, Alt FW. Recombination and transcription of the endogenous Ig heavy chain locus is effected by the Ig heavy chain intronic enhancer core region in the absence of the matrix attachment regions. _Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A_. 1999 Feb 16;96(4):1526-31. <a class="pubmed-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9990057" target="_blank">[Pubmed]</a>

#### Summary

E-mu is an enhancer within the IgH locus that governs the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. Here the authors delete E-mu and generate chimeric mice to demonstrate that the loss of E-mu greatly reduces the efficiency of V(D)J rearrangement, though the loss of E-mu does not entirely prevent rearrangement.

* Pro-B cells must assemble their immunoglobulin sequences by rearranging variable gene segments from the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) regions of the immunoglobulin locus. 
* The mechanisms behind V(D)J recombination are still being uncovered, but researchers have identified many cis-regulatory elements that guide the recombination process.
* One such element is the enhancer E-mu, which is located between the J region and the first constant region, C-mu
* E-mu was first identified in transfection assays as able to drive transcription
* E-mu has a 220 bp core region, and two flanking Matrix Attachment Regions (MARs) that are able to bind the nuclear matrix
* The authors previously showed that replacing E-mu with a gene cassette greatly reduced J recombination efficiency, but subsequent studies that replaced E-mu with a short oligonucleotide found that E-mu was helpful but not necessary for rearrangement
* Here, the authors readdress this question with targeted deletions of the E-mu core and flanking regions, alone or in combination, in mouse ES cells
* Chimeric mice were generated with a neo gene cassette replacement of the entire 1kb E-mu region (RE-mu) or with the region deleted (dE-mu)
* The RE-mu B cells showed a deficiency in D to J rearrangement, but the dE-mu cells did not, implying the neo cassette was impeding early recombination
* Both mice showed a significant reduction in V to DJ rearrangement in splenic B cells, implying that the E-mu-lacking mutant allele was unable to recombine efficiently after assembly of the DJ junction
* Deleting just the core enhancer of E-mu similarly reduced recombination efficiency
* In contrast, deletion of the 3' MAR, the 5' MAR, or both MARs did not have any effect on the efficiency of recombination seen in peripheral B cells

#### Observations

* A keystone enhancer for gene rearrangement rather than expression, although expression of the ultimate immunoglobulin is implied
* What is E-mu doing? Subsequent and ongoing research indicates the establishment of histone marks and precise IgH locus looping requires E-mu
* YY1 (typically a promoter factor?) binds to E-mu and is similarly necessary for V to DJ rearrangement
