_Mol Cell_. 2002 Feb;9(2):291-302. <a class="pubmed-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11864603" target="_blank">[Pubmed]</a>

#### Summary
The hGH gene cluster has an upstream locus control region (LCR) necessary for transgene expression and endogenous gene activation. The LCR contains five DNaseI hypersensitivity sites, one of which, HS1, is here identified as crucial for recruitment of the Pit-1 transcription factor and the spread of acetylation from the LCR to the gene cluster. Loss of HS1 leads to loss of acetylation, loss of Pit-1 at the promoter of the hGH-N gene, and thus loss of hGH-N expression in the pituitary.

* An 87kb transgene encompassing the LCR and the hGH cluster has been previously shown to recapitulate the endogenous behavior of the hGH locus.
* The authors first create a version of the 87kb transgene lacking two Pit-1 binding sites in HS1.
* The resultant transgene mutant loses the open chromatin at HS1 altogether (99bp).
* In the pituitary, the hGH transgene typically gets acetylated through the LCR and hGH-N gene. Without HS1, both H3 and H4 acetylation were lost across the entire locus.
* The WT transgene achieves 35-55% of endogenous expression. Without HS1, the transgene reproduces only 1-4% of endogenous expression. 
* Notably, placental hGH-A expression was unaffected, implying HS1 is specific for the pituitary expression of hGH-N.
* HS3 deletion does not affect hGH-N expression levels.
* HS1 deletion results in lower occupancy of Pit-1 at the hGH-N promoter, implying the Pit-1 sites in HS1 are necessary for recruitment of the crucial factor to the gene promoter.

#### Observations

* The approach of comparing transgenes is interesting. Less ideal than knocking out the enhancer endogenously, but circumvents some of the difficulties involved with that approach.
* There appears to be little measurable activity in the ENCODE cell lines, though there are several DNaseI HS sites in the area.
