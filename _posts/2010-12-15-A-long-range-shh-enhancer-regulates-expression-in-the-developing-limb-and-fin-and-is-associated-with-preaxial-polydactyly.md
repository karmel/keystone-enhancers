developing limb and fin and is associated with preaxial polydactyly. _Hum Mol

#### Summary
Sonic Hedge Hog (Shh) expression levels are associated with congenital limb malformation, and point mutations in the Shh gene have been associated with deficiencies in limb development. Here, the authors trace down an association on chromosome 7q36 with preaxial polydactyly to a distal enhancer that regulates Shh expression in the developing limb bud.

* The Sasquatch mutant mouse (Ssq) displays preaxial polydactyly (PPD). The transgenic insertion is on mouse chromosome 5, which maps to the human locus chromosome 7q36.
* 7q36 has been associated with a number of congenital hand malformations.
* Analysis of the insertion point in the Ssq mouse and a breakpoint in a patient with PPD implicated a region 1Mb upstream of Shh, in a Lmbr1 intron. 
* To investigate the nature of the insertion in the Ssq mouse, the authors made cosmid libraries containing the insertion site and flanking DNA. This cosmid (Cos33S) was able to drive an HPAP reporter that mirrored Shh expression in the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA).
* The authors next identified highly conserved regions within the relevant Lmbr1 intron, comparing known mouse and human sequences and sequencing the chick intron as well. A 800bp region was conserved through all three species.
* The authors further sequenced regions from the Fugu pufferfish, and identified a 400bp region conserved across all four species. Further, the compact Fugu genome made the physical association between the Lmbr1 intron and Shh apparent.
* The 445bp region drove lacZ expression in a transgene comparable to Shh expression.
* Further analysis of Cos33S helped limit the necessary region to 305bp.
* Permanent transgenics were made with the 1.7kb containing region and the 445bp region. Beta-gal in these transgenics mirrored Shh expression and spatio-temporal dynamics.
* A total of seven families with PPD mapping to 7q36 were analyzed, along with more than ethnically matched 500 controls.
* A handful of heterozygous mutations unique to the affected individuals were identified, and these mapped to the conserved enhancer region. None of the unaffected siblings or controls had mutations at these sites.

#### Observations

* This study identifies a disease-relevant enhancer and its mechanism of action, shows that it's relevant in multiple organisms, and partially sequence several species and hundreds of individuals, all before the completed human genome. Why is this not in a big-name journal? Am I missing some major flaw?
* Being able to tie to point mutations in mice and humans is critical here. Otherwise, the transgenes show the enhancer is sufficient but not specifically necessary. 
* Again we see conservation as an important determining factor, both in finding the enhancer and in the nucleotides that seem to matter when mutated.
