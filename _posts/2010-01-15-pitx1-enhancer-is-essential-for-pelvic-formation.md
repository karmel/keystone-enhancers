Adaptive evolution of pelvic reduction in sticklebacks by recurrent deletion of a Pitx1 enhancer. _Science_. 2010 Jan 15;327(5963):302-5. <a class="pubmed-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20007865" target="_blank">[Pubmed]</a>

#### Summary
Populations of stickleback fish have repeatedly lost pelvic structures. Genome-wide linkage mapping of a number of stickleback populations reveals that the coding region of Pitx1, a gene essential for pelvic formation, does not vary, but the loss of a tissue-spevific enhancer upstream of Pitx1 is well-correlated with the loss of the pelvic girdle.

* Most sticklebacks have a pelvis, but over two dozen strains have separately lost the pelvic structure, presumably due to positive selection of a more streamlined body.
* Linkage analysis identified a region that is highly associated with the size of the pelvic structure across many strains
* These region contains Pitx1, which is necessary for hindlimb development in other animals
* The coding region of Pitx1 itself is not changing among the strains
* In order to rule out whole-body developmental deffects, the authors cross a fish with a pelvis and without, and show that the F1 has preferential expression of the Pitx1 gene from the pelvis-containing fish in the pelvic tissue, but normal expression of Pitx1 in the head.
* High-resolution mapping of crosses revealed a 124kb region around Pitx1 that was crucial to pelvic phenotype
* The enhancer region was further localized with an EGFP reporter driven by the hsp70 promoter and different segments region in question.
* A 501bp regulatory region is sufficient to drive EGFP expression
* A transgene composed of the 2.5kb region containing the 501kb region upstream of Pitx1 plus the Pitx1 gene was able to rescue pelvis-lacking fish, resulting in the formation of pelvic spines
* BAC sequencing of different populations showed that each population had a different deletion, with the three sequenced strains overlapping over a 488bp region that coincided with the 501bp enhancer determined earlier
* Further genotyping of strains finds nine different haplotypes defining the 13 pelvic-reduced populations
* Pitx1 is located in a fragile region of the genome, near a telomeric end with a high degree of DNA flexibility
* Around the deleted enhancer, the sticklebacks showed a high degree of homozygosity, implying positive selection via a sweep
* Thus, regulatory regions in fragile portions of the genome can yield relatively sudden phenotypic change

#### Observations

* Again, cell-type specificity is key to the finding of the enhancer
* Hard to compare stickleback to mammalian datasets, unfortunately. There are a number of conserved regions 0 - 30kbp upstream o Pitx1, some of which show H3K4me1 marks across diverse cell types. One K562-specific enhancer ~20kbp upstream, but unclear how that relates to sticklebacks.
