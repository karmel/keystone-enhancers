Sur IK, Hallikas O, Vähärautio A, Yan J, Turunen M, Enge M, Taipale M, Karhu A, Aaltonen LA, Taipale J. Mice lacking a Myc enhancer that includes human SNP rs6983267 are resistant to intestinal tumors. _Science_. 2012 Dec 7;338(6112):1360-3. <a class="pubmed-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23118011" target="_blank">[Pubmed]</a>

#### Summary
The SNP rs6983267 has previously been associated with tumorigenesis. In this study, the authors demonstrate that this SNP is contained in an enhancer that positively regulates Myc expression levels by conditionally deleting the conserved enhancer in a mouse model. The Myc-335 KO mouse has moderately decreased expression of Myc in the colon, and is resistant to polyp formation when crossed with the tumor-prone Apc(min) mouse.

* GWASs have previously identified SNPs upstream of Myc that are associated with a number of different cancers
* One SNP, rs6983267, has been shown to be associated with Myc expression levels in the cell line DLD-1
* rs6983267 affects binding of TCF7L2, a player in colorectal tumorigenesis
* The regulatory region containing rs6983267 is 300kb away from the Myc promoter, but 3C shows looping occurs
* Still, effects of this SNP on Myc expression in humans are difficult to find
* rs6983267 is conserved in mice, so a conditional KO mouse for the regulatory element surrounding rs6983267 was created (Myc-335)
* Under normal conditions, Myc-335 KO mice have no overt phenotype
* Myc expression was normal in the duodenum, but decreasedin the colon
* Chip-seq of TCF7L2 in the colon shows complete loss of binding peak at Myc-335 enhancer
* Still, colons were normal, as was fertility of the mice. Perhaps the decrease in Myc expression is important only in tumorigenesis?
* Cross Myc-335 KOs with Apc(min) mice.
* Myc-335 KO/Apc(min) mice have fewer polyps in the intestines as compared to Apc(min) controls
* So, Myc-335 is an enhancer that moderately increases Myc expression such that loss of the enhancer confers resistance to  tumorigenesis

#### Observations

* The effect size on Myc is minimal, but because Myc levels are so crucial in tumorigenesis, even this minimal effect is important
* What effect does the disruption of TCF7L2 binding site have on other TFs in that region? On the efficiency of looping?
* Encode shows high level of cell-specific H3K27Ac in lung fibroblast line (NHLF), and DHS sites in another lung fibroblast.
* Many TF sites surrounding the SNP, including for CTCF and Stat3
